# Discord API Wrapper

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/veteran-software/discord-api-wrapper.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/veteran-software/discord-api-wrapper)

## Purpose

This wrapper is rather incomplete vs other popular wrappers for Discord's REST API.  It was developed for a proprietary 
project.

## Use

> NOTE:  This wrapper always uses the latest version of the Discord API
> 
>  Gateway Version: 9

If you wish to import this library into your project, please read [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/veteran-software/discord-api-wrapper/blob/main/LICENSE.md) 
before doing so.  We recommend directly importing this library and not using a fork unless you wish to actively 
update it.  The Discord REST API changes frequently, so updating can be daunting at times.
